      "correct_answer": "Rs. 5000",
      "solution": "If the difference between SI and CI for 2 years is Rs. x, then Principal = x (100/r)^2. Here, P = 50 x (100x100)/(10x10) → P = 5000."

      "correct_answer": "Rs. 5000",
      "solution": "If the difference between SI and CI for 2 years is Rs. x, Principal = x (100/r)^2. Therefore, P = 162 x (100x100)/(18x18) → P = 5000."

      "correct_answer": "8%",
      "solution": "SI = Rs. 200 and CI = Rs. 208. The difference of Rs. 8 is the interest on the first year's interest, hence R = (8x100)/(100x1)% = 8%."
